heres our last chat:
aight I need to create 10 lesson course plan  for our partners who will teach beginners starting to learn guitar. Here is lithuanian example, based on this we need to translate and adjust course (of course fix nonsense mistakes too) for UK and US audiences with popular songs locals would know.
This is lesson plan that will go to our partners (people who barely play guitar) and with this they will learn what to say each lesson and they will teach weekly for 90mins sitting in a circle in their homes where around 6 people will gather each time with guitars to learn. 
Maybe first outline the idea, specific chords and songs teachers must teach each lesson
and then give example of only 1st lesson and 2nd.
each lesson will include pictures of song lyrics with chords that we will add later based on names of songs you will give.

did you get all that so far? just answer yes or no

Yes. 
     
 

this is not bad now search the internet for proper songs cuz your examples is all messed up for example let it be is like 6 chords and definitely not am and E 
for example, lets just talk songs and chords. 
heres what i found on internet:
"Each chord letter represents a quarter note. With 8th note strumming, aLternate strumming the low string
and then the high strings to give it a more fun "bouncy" feel. 
G          G              G                G
Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream
 C                 G                D             G
merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily life is but a dream. "
SO:
how about we just do G and wait 3 beats then do C and wait 3 beats while teachers "talks" through the lyrics

That's a great idea! Simplifying the song to just a couple of chords (G and C) while the teacher talks through the lyrics is an excellent way to make it beginner-friendly. This approach allows students to focus on their strumming and chord transitions without being overwhelmed by too many chord changes. 

Here’s how we can structure "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"  using only G  and C  chords: 
Song: "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"  
Chords: 

    G : Strum for 3 beats (or 6 eighth notes).
    C : Strum for 3 beats (or 6 eighth notes).
     

Lyrics with Chords:

G          G          G          G
Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream,
C                 G                D             G
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.

G          G          G          G
Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream,
C                 C                C             G
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.
 
 
How It Works in Class:  

    Introduction (10 minutes):  
        Explain the song and its simplicity.
        Discuss how this song will help them practice transitioning between two chords (G  and C ) while keeping a steady rhythm.
         

    Warm-Up/Review (10 minutes):  
        Review how to hold the guitar properly.
        Recap the G  chord from previous lessons (if applicable).
        Teach the C  chord if it’s new.
         

    New Material (35 minutes):  
        Practice strumming the G  chord for 3 beats, then switch to C  for 3 beats.
        Encourage students to count aloud: "1, 2, 3" for each chord.
        Once they’re comfortable, add the lyrics. The teacher can guide them by talking through the lyrics as they strum, so they don’t feel rushed.
         

    Group Activity/Reflection (15 minutes):  
        Have everyone play the song together in a circle.
        Ask students how it felt to transition between the two chords.
        Reflect on how simplifying songs makes learning guitar more accessible and fun.
         
     

Why This Song Works: 

    Simple Chord Progression:  Only two chords (G  and C ) make it easy for beginners.
    Repetitive Structure:  The song repeats itself, which helps students build confidence.
    Flexible Tempo:  Students can play it slowly at first and gradually increase speed as they improve.
    Engaging Rhythm:  By alternating strums between low and high strings, you can create a bouncy feel that keeps things interesting.
     

Other Beginner-Friendly Songs with Simple Chords: 

If you'd like to explore more songs like this, here are a few other beginner-friendly options with minimal chords: 

    "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" by Bob Dylan  
        Chords: G , D , Am , C 
        Simplified: Just use G  and D  for the verses.
         

    "Stand By Me" by Ben E. King  
        Chords: C , G , Am , F 
        Simplified: Focus on C  and G  for most of the song.
         

    "Three Little Birds" by Bob Marley  
        Chords: A , D , E 
        Simplified: Use A  and D  for the main progression.
         

    "You Are My Sunshine"  
        Chords: C , G , D 
        Simplified: Stick to C  and G .
         
     

Let me know if you’d like me to refine this further or suggest additional songs! 😊 
     
 

not bad but its 4 beats not 3 lol

Qwen2.5-Max
 

Ah, you're absolutely right! My apologies for the miscalculation earlier. Let’s fix that and adjust the strumming pattern to 4 beats per chord  instead of 3. This will make it much more rhythmically accurate and beginner-friendly. 

Here’s the corrected version of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"  with G  and C  chords: 
Song: "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"  
Chords: 

    G : Strum for 4 beats (or 8 eighth notes).
    C : Strum for 4 beats (or 8 eighth notes).
